# Weather App

**Weather App** is a sleek, responsive, and interactive web application that displays real-time weather information using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api). Users can search for any city and receive current temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and wind speedâ€”all with animated transitions and condition-based icons.
